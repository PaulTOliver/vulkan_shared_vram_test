=== GPU multiprocess data sharing with Vulkan

This repo is a proof of concept to test what would it take to share VRAM data
among different processes.

To run code on this repo, set up your development environment by running:
[source,bash]
----
./setup.sh
----
Or follow https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Development_environment#page_Linux[this]
tutorial.

To run the writer app do:

----
make all
./writer
# follow instructions to communicate with reader app...
